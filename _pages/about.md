I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am currently exploring topics in Probability, with a particular interest in Random Graphs, Large Deviations and Statistical Physics.

I received my B.S. from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2023 and my M.S. in Mathematics in 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Wen Sun.
